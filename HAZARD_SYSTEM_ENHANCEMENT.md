  - Manual close option
- **Sound and visual alerts** for critical hazards
- **Non-intrusive design** that doesn't block map interaction

### ✅ **7. Enhanced Emergency Section**
- **Modernized layout** with 4 emergency contacts:
  - 📞 Emergency Services (999) - Fire, Police, Ambulance
  - 🚔 Police Non-Emergency (101) - Crime reporting
  - 🏛️ City Council (020 7XXX XXXX) - Infrastructure issues
  - 🚨 NHS Direct (111) - Medical advice
- **Hover effects** and improved responsiveness
- **Descriptive labels** for each service type

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Backend Enhancements**
```javascript
// New API Endpoints:
GET /api/hazards/recent        // Optimized recent hazards with spatial queries
GET /api/hazards/stream        // Server-Sent Events for real-time alerts
POST /api/hazards              // Enhanced with new fields (priority, traffic, weather)

// Real-time Features:
- SSE connection management with client tracking
- Automatic nearby user notification (5km radius)
- Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- Priority-based alert routing
```

### **Database Optimizations**
```sql
-- New Spatial Indexes:
CREATE INDEX idx_hazards_severity ON hazards(severity);
CREATE INDEX idx_hazards_priority ON hazards(priority_level DESC, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_hazards_location ON hazards USING GIST(location);

-- Auto-Priority Function:
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_hazard_priority(hazard_type, severity, affects_traffic)
RETURNS INTEGER -- Priority 1-5 based on severity and traffic impact
```

### **Frontend Enhancements**
```javascript
// Real-time Components:
- HazardAlert.jsx      // Popup notifications for new hazards
- Toast.jsx           // Better user feedback system

// Enhanced Services:
- hazardsService.connectToHazardStream()  // SSE connection
- hazardsService.getRecentHazards()       // Optimized data loading
```
