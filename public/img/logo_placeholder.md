# Logo Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the London Safety Routing logo.

## Instructions for adding the logo:

1. Place your logo image in this directory
2. Name it `logo.png` or `logo.svg`
3. Ensure the image is optimized for web use
4. Recommended dimensions: 40x40px minimum for navbar display

## Current Implementation:

The application is configured to use `/img/logo.png` in the following components:
- `components/Navbar.jsx` - Navigation bar logo
- `app/layout.jsx` - Favicon and metadata

## Logo Requirements:

- Format: PNG, SVG, or JPG
- Size: 40x40px to 200x200px
- Background: Transparent (for PNG/SVG)
- Style: Should match the application's blue/teal color scheme

## Alternative:

If no logo is available, the application will gracefully degrade to show the text "London Safety Routing" or use a default placeholder icon.
